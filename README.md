AppSqueeze is a simple application packager for MacOS.
Just choose an icon, type up a title and some information, and you're good to go!
A fully structured MacOS app will be generated after you select your executable!

Your executable can be anything runnable - a shell script, a bit of python, whatever.
Make sure you have a shebang, of course!
